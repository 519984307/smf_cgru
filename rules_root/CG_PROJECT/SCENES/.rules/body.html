	Scenes asset shows thumbnail and status information on every project shot.
</p>
<p>
	Thumbnails are generated automatically by Shot asset (it sends such request for server).
	So if some thumbnail presents you can see that somebody started to work with a shot.

	Search performed in Scenes asset is very fast, as it is not a server side search, it is just GUI shows/hides shots.
