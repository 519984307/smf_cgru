# This is an example paths map file

# This is a comment

# At first Afanasy searches pathsmap files at home in "~./afanasy/pathmap*", so every user can customize paths.
# Then in a current directory ".", and every client can have some paths map.
# And at last in Afanasy root directory "AF_ROOT", which can be the same (network) for everyone during job submission.

#     Client:                 Server:

#\\server\projects\          /cg/projects/
