# This is an example paths map file

# This is a comment

# At first Afanasy searches pathsmap files at home in "~./afanasy/pathmap*", so every user can customize paths.
# Then in a current directory ".", and every client can have some paths map.
# And at last in Afanasy root directory "AF_ROOT", which can be the same (network) for everyone during job submission.

#     Client:                 Server:

#\\server\projects\          /mnt/prj/

# You can use only "\" slashes for windows, even if some application on windows use "/" slashes.
# Afanasy tries both slashes when searchs a path to replace.
# But will replace with specified slashes, if unix slashes not forced (for Nuke, for example).
