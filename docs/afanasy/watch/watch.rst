=====

Watch is a Qt GUI for Afanasy.


Modes
-----

It has several user modes for farm administration purposes:

 - **USER** user mode:

 	User can change his parameters and operate his jobs only.

 - **VISOR** super user mode:

 	Can change parameter of any user and operate jobs of any user.

 - **GOD** admin mode:

 	Can do anything, operate any user, any job and farm (renders and pools).

To switch user mode you need to type password in active Watch window
(you do not need to re-login to switch between modes).
To reset super user mode you can type password again.


UI Levels
---------

At first Watch was designed as a minimalistic GUI, like hand watches.
With a lots of abbreviated words, to fit lots of information on a small screen.
But later it begin to grow and got several UI levels to display brief or full info.

 - **Padawan**
 	You will see parameters with a full names.
	Useful when you just started to use Afanasy.
 - **Jedi**
	You will see parameters with a brief names.
	Useful when you know most parameters.
 - **Sith**
	You will see parameters with a abbreviated names.
	It is like on hand watches, where you see "TU 4", intsead of "Today it is Tuesday, 4th August 2020 Year",
	as you are definitely know that it is August 2020,
	"TU" is Tuesday, and next "4" number means the day of month.

	Main window menu will disappear for space economy.
	It will be available on RMB menu at window top.
