Setup
=====

If you run Blender from CGRU Keeper, it addon will be added automatically.

You can setup CGRU addon manually. It is located in:

``/opt/cgru/plugins/blender``

Or in some custom location you have unpacked CGRU in.

	Blender Preferences Window

If you run blender not from CGRU and installed addon manually,
you should setup CGRU location for the addon.
It needed as the addon uses other python scripts from CGRU.
